# cr_discord_bot
Right now the bot can take one command -> !getPlayerInfo "player tag"

This returns the player tag and the player name right now. But will in future return more data about the player. Also a command for clan info will be added.

The bot gets its data from the Clash Royale api. The fetching of the data is done in the cr_api.py file.
